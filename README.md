Sales Data Analytics System

This project is a Python-based Sales Data Analytics System developed as part of Module 3 (Python Programming).
The system processes messy sales transaction data, applies data cleaning and validation rules, enriches records using an external API, performs sales analysis, and generates structured output reports.

The project demonstrates practical use of Python for file handling, data validation, API integration, modular programming, and reporting.

Features

Data Cleaning
Automatically detects and removes invalid sales records based on defined business rules.

Data Validation
Enforces constraints such as valid transaction IDs, positive quantities, and valid prices.

Sales Analysis
Computes total revenue and product-wise sales performance.

API Integration
Uses the requests library to fetch product-related information from an external API and enrich sales data.

Report Generation
Generates:
